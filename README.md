# matasano-clj

A work in progress. Clojure solutions to the Matasano Crypto Challenge.

https://cryptopals.com/

Done to supplement learning more Clojure with some programming exercises.

Don't know how many of these I'll do...
but my main motivation is seeing how this 'feels' in Clojure, comparing against Haskell, or Python.

At time of writing, I'm in the process of deciding whether Clojure is a language to spend more time studying,
or whether something else would be more useful.

So far, I like it in theory. But need to get some more hands-on experience.
